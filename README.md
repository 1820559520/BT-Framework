BT-Framework
============

BT Framework is a behavior tree framework that can be used to create game AI. It's written for Unity3d.

## How to use
1. Create a class inheriting from BTTree, and construct the behavior tree in Init function.
2. Drag the class to a GameObject.
3. Create various actions and pre-conditions inheriting from BTAction and BTPrecondition.

It's this simple!

## Benefits
1. Improves modularity of code
2. Improves reusability of logics
